====================
RDS First Time Setup
====================

We will need to manually setup our RDS. So far throughout this class we have been setting up our database with Hibernate which has been creating our tables for us, and copying data in from our CSVs. We will be doing this manually today, so we don't have to send up two different builds of our project.
